      text: "Growing up, I had a strong aptitude for mathematics. However my overall A-Level results didnâ€™t meet expectationsâ€”something that drew criticism from peers. Despite this, I stayed true to my interests. During National Service, a friend introduced me to Python, sparking a passion for programming that led me to explore fields from cybersecurity to automation. It was Data Science and AI, however, that truly resonated with meâ€”combining problem-solving with real-world impact. At SMU, I joined the Business Intelligence & Analytics Clubâ€™s Data Associate Programme, where I gained hands-on experience and found a like-minded community. Earning a fully-funded DSTA scholarship to pursue Computer Science was a turning point, affirming my growth. Today, as President of SMU BIA, I continue to learn and pay it forward by guiding others along their own tech journeys.",

      text: "Iâ€™ve always loved breaking down complex concepts. Writing articles has become more than just a way to inform othersâ€”itâ€™s a method of self-discipline and reflection. Honestly, I write these pieces to keep myself constantly in check with the latest developments in AI and to reinforce the foundational knowledge I need to explore deeper applications and research. Each article I publish helps me stay connected to the fast-moving landscape of artificial intelligence while sharpening my ability to communicate ideas clearlyâ€”an essential skill for anyone pursuing a career in public service. As an aspiring AI engineer, I hope to use this habit not only to grow personally, but to contribute meaningfully to society by making advanced technologies easier to understand, adopt, and trust.",
